{"topic": "Emission Limits", "question": "What is the PM limit for N1 vehicles under BS-VI?", "answer": "The PM (Particulate Matter) emission limit for N1 category vehicles under BS-VI is 0.005 g/km. This limit applies to light commercial vehicles and helps reduce particulate emissions from diesel engines.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 3, Table 3"}
{"topic": "Emission Limits", "question": "What are the NOx and CO limits for M1 category diesel vehicles?", "answer": "Under BS-VI, M1 category diesel vehicles must meet NOx limits of 0.08 g/km and CO limits of 0.5 g/km. These limits are measured during the WLTP test cycle.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 3, Table 3"}
{"topic": "RDE", "question": "What is the NOx conformity factor under BS-VI RDE?", "answer": "The NOx conformity factor for RDE under BS-VI is 1.5. This means that NOx emissions in real-world driving should not exceed 1.5 times the regulatory limit measured in the lab.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.5.2"}
{"topic": "Fuel Specific", "question": "Is EVP required for diesel vehicles?", "answer": "No, EVP systems are not required for diesel vehicles because diesel has very low volatility and does not produce significant evaporative emissions. These systems are only required for volatile fuels like petrol, LPG, and CNG. Therefore, diesel vehicles are exempt due to the nature of the fuel, not due to omission in regulation.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.3"}
