{"topic": "Emission Limits", "question": "What is the PM limit for N1 vehicles under BS-VI?", "answer": "The PM (Particulate Matter) emission limit for N1 category vehicles under BS-VI is 0.005 g/km. This limit applies to light commercial vehicles and helps reduce particulate emissions from diesel engines.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 3, Table 3"}
{"topic": "Emission Limits", "question": "What are the NOx and CO limits for M1 category diesel vehicles?", "answer": "Under BS-VI, M1 category diesel vehicles must meet NOx limits of 0.08 g/km and CO limits of 0.5 g/km. These limits are measured during the WLTP test cycle.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 3, Table 3"}
{"topic": "RDE", "question": "Is RDE applicable to diesel vehicles under BS-VI?", "answer": "Yes, Real Driving Emission (RDE) testing is applicable to diesel vehicles under BS-VI. It became mandatory from April 2023 for type approval of M and N category vehicles.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.5.1"}
{"topic": "RDE", "question": "What is the NOx conformity factor under BS-VI RDE?", "answer": "The NOx conformity factor for RDE under BS-VI is 1.5. This means that NOx emissions in real-world driving should not exceed 1.5 times the regulatory limit measured in the lab.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.5.2"}
{"topic": "OBD", "question": "What does OBD-II monitor in BS-VI vehicles?", "answer": "OBD-II monitors emission-critical systems including catalytic converters, particulate filters, NOx sensors, fuel system integrity, and misfire detection. It helps detect faults and ensure compliance.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 7.2.1"}
{"topic": "OBD", "question": "When does OBD-II become mandatory for M1 vehicles?", "answer": "OBD-II becomes mandatory for M1 category vehicles under BS-VI Phase 2 from April 2023 onwards.", "source": "MoRTH Notification GSR-889(E)"}
{"topic": "Test Cycles", "question": "Which test cycle is used for type approval of passenger vehicles under BS-VI?", "answer": "The WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure) cycle is used for type approval of M1 and N1 vehicles under BS-VI.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 4.1"}
{"topic": "Test Cycles", "question": "What test cycle is used for engine-level testing of heavy-duty diesel vehicles?", "answer": "The WHTC (World Harmonized Transient Cycle) and WHSC (World Harmonized Steady Cycle) are used for type approval of CI engines in heavy-duty vehicles.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 5.3"}
{"topic": "Timeline", "question": "When were BS-VI emission norms implemented in India?", "answer": "BS-VI norms were implemented for all motor vehicles in India starting from 1st April 2020.", "source": "GSR-889(E), MoRTH"}
{"topic": "EV/Hybrid Exemptions", "question": "Are electric vehicles required to meet BS-VI emission limits?", "answer": "No, electric vehicles (EVs) do not have internal combustion engines and are not subject to BS-VI emission limits. However, hybrids with ICE components must comply.", "source": "AIS-137 General Provisions"}
{"topic": "Fuel Specific", "question": "Why is EVP not required for diesel vehicles?", "answer": "Diesel fuel has very low volatility and produces negligible evaporative emissions. Therefore, evaporative emission control systems (EVP) are not required for diesel vehicles under BS-VI.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.3"}
{"topic": "Fuel Specific", "question": "Is EVP required for diesel vehicles?", "answer": "No, EVP systems are not required for diesel vehicles because diesel has very low volatility and does not produce significant evaporative emissions. These systems are only required for volatile fuels like petrol, LPG, and CNG. Therefore, diesel vehicles are exempt due to the nature of the fuel, not due to omission in regulation.", "source": "AIS-137 Part 4, Clause 6.3"}
